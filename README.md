# WeatherApp
This weather app is being made for my final project in the SheCodes Plus Bootcamp.
From the start, my goal has been to make a weather app that looks great on the small screen of a cell phone.  
The reason for this is so many times, myself and other end-users are checking the weather while running out the door for work, errands, or some other engagement.  
We are doing this, so we know if we need to grab a jacket or if we will be commuting through a rainstorm or snow.  
Ultimately this has been the user experience that has been living in the back of my mind.
